== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I customize the column mappings when importing users? =

When importing users, you can specify the column number for each user attribute (e.g., username, email, first name, last name, etc.) used in the CSV file. This allows you to map the CSV columns to the corresponding user attributes in WordPress.

= Can I skip the first row in the CSV file if it contains header information? =

Yes, you can skip the first row in the CSV file by checking the 'CSV file has header' option in the import form. This option skips the first row during the import process.

= How can I prevent existing users from being updated during import? =

You can prevent existing users from being updated by checking the 'Do not update existing users' option in the import form. This option ensures that only new users are created during the import process.
